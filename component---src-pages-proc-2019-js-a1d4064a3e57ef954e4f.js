The ICSE 2019 proceeding is the third proceeding to be published and act as a continuation of the 2nd International Conference on Special Education Proceedings. The papers in this proceeding are evidence of research-based practices that will contribute to the building of knowledge and expertise of Special Education teachers in this region and beyond. SEAMEO SEN is committed to its vision and mission as a leading centre of excellence in Special Education in this region.
