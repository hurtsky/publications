The ICSE 2017 proceeding is the second proceeding to\n              be published after the ICSE 2015 proceeding that was jointly\n              published with the Ministry of Education Thailand. The ICSE 2017\n              is a continuation of the 2nd International Conference on Special\n              Education that is held this year in Borneo Convention Center in\n              Kuching Sarawak, Malaysia. The papers in this proceeding are\n              evidence of research based practices that will contribute to the\n              building of knowledge and expertise of Special Education teachers\n              in this region and beyond. SEAMEO SEN is committed to its vision\n              and mission as a leading center of excellence in Special Education\n              in this region. This conference is a definitive effort and hard\n              work by SEAMEO SEN to present opportunities and platforms for\n              convergence of discussion and current ideas in Special Education\n              to all its attendees. The papers published in this proceeding are\n              papers that are written and documented based on the sub themes of\n              the conference which are mainly focused on inclusive education,\n              innovations in Special Education and also on best practices in all\n              areas of Special Education. On behalf of the reviewing committee\n              team ICSE 2017, I would like to extend my appreciative note to the\n              presenters who have contributed to the papers in this proceeding.\n              The papers explicated and documented are very valuable to all\n              Special Education educators in this region and for all educators\n              worldwide. With the publication of this proceeding the papers\n              published will be used as reference and source of information for\n              educators. I am also extending my utmost appreciation to the\n              experts of the reviewing team, the technical writers and the whole\n              team from SEAMEO SEN for the publication of this proceeding. Much\n              effort, time and technical work have been invested to ensure the\n              proceeding will be published with standard and quality. I am sure\n              our effort will be appreciated by the end users of this\n              proceeding. I wish all the presenters and writers the best of luck\n              in their future undertakings. Working within the Special Education\n              field in the 21st century is indeed very challenging. The papers\n              documented in this proceeding is the evidence of passion and love\n              that we have for the betterment of our children with Special\n              Education Needs. May all of us continue to work harder and become\n              more resilient in our endeavor to champion the cause for our\n              Special Children in this region.
